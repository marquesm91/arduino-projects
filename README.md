# Arduino Projects

All projects are sharing the **lib** folder.

All Sketches were made using Fritzing.

## Multitask Leds

For this project I created a class named Led that could have a runtime and a downtime. If desired, the Led state could be changed manually.

### Component list

* 3 leds
* 3 resistors 220 ohm
* 4 Jump wires

## ButtonLeadLed

The button has the goal to change the Led state if pressed. If you hold it the Led will not blink.

### Component list

* 1 led
* 1 button
* 1 resistor 10k ohm
* 1 resistor 220 ohm
* 4 Jump wires

## Parking Sensor

Reproducing the system we can find in any shopping parking nowdays. I used a potenciometer to regulate the distance beteween the sensor and object.

### Component list

* 2 leds
* 1 potenciometer 10k ohm
* 1 Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04
* 2 resistor 200 ohm
* 11 Jump wires

## RControl

Controlling your Samsung TV (later others) using a IR emissor with **IRremote** library.

### Component list

* 1 Infrared emissor
* 1 Infrared receptor
* 1 resistor 150 ohm
* 2 Jump wires
