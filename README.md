# Arduino Projects made by myself

All projects are sharing the **lib** folder.

All Sketchs were made using Fritzing.

## Multitask Leds

For this project I created a class named Led that could have a runtime and a downtime. If desired, the Led state could be changed manually.

### Component list

* 3 leds
* 3 resistors 220 ohm
* 4 Jump wires

## ButtonLeadLed

The button has the goal to change the Led state if pressed. If you hold it the Led will not blink.

### Component list

* 1 led
* 1 button
* 1 resistor 10k ohm
* 1 resistor 220 ohm
* 4 Jump wires
